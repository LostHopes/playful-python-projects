# Random names generator

The goal of this small project to generate silly names and print it to the stdout.
We combine first names and surnames to get the result.
Built-in python library "random" will help us to achieve this.

```python
import random
```

You can test it by creating python virtual environment and installing pytest.
Here is the steps to reproduce:
1. python -m venv .env
2. source .env/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. pytest

## Additional features and requirements for the project

1. Be able to read firstnames and surnames from the text file
2. Create variables and function names understand for the people who don't even know python
