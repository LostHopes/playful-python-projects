# Random names generator

The goal of this small project to generate silly names and print it to the stdout.
We combine first names and surnames to get the result.
Built-in python library "random" will help us to achieve this.

```python
import random
```

You can test it by creating python virtual environment and installing pytest.
Here is the steps to reproduce:
1. python -m venv .env
2. source .env/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. pytest
